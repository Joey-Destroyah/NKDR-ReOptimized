manufacturer = Los Alamos National Laboratory
description = The W76 Mod 2 is a MIRV warhead with a yield of 7 Kilotons of TNT. Being a MIRV, it can be placed onto SLBMs, IRBMs, or most commonly, ICBMs. It uses GPS navigation to ensure precise obliteration on whatever target you so happen to lase with a local spy satellite. This lil guy is small enough to be loaded onto the infamous Trident II SLBM as 12 MIRVs
