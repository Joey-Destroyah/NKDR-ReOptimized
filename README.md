# NKDR-ReOptimized
is an **unofficial** fork of Joseano's and BrettRyland's NKD Renewed and Extended mod.
Which itself is a fork of NKDR, made by the author of the *og* North Kerbin Dynamics mod, harpwner and cukko (who is known on GitHub as dogevspenguin)
Which itself is a fork of the OG North Kerbin Dynamics Mod made by harpwner.

Credits aside, my aim is to edit the configs of various missiles and bombs in order to give them all realistic and optimized dimensions, values, and trajectories. 
e.g. The W88 got shrunk to a MUCH more reasonable size and mass and a new description, and I'm planning on giving the JASSM a terminal weave and the Tomahawk a Pop-up attack.
Unfortunately, the plumes for each missile are **hardcoded into the model files, and not in the configs**, so I cannot change or get rid of the plumes. 
I don't blame harpwner since the mod's code was originally made for **1.3.1, from a DECADE AGO, in 2015**

So unless someone knows how to steal plumes from model.mu files, we're stuck with the explodium jet engine plumes


== TO DO LIST ==

✅ Add W76 MIRVS (using the preexisiting MIRV models; Credits to Harpwner ofc)
➗ JASSM Weave and Tomahawk pop-up
➗ Fine-tuning MLRS Rockets
❌I need help fixing their cluster bomb explosions

Whatever is suggested that doesn't require modelling experience since i've never done blender. Put something in an issue if ya want a customization not listed here.

======KNOWN ISSUE======

BDA+ version 1.12.0 has a bug wherein you *cannot* lock onto terrain, but *only vessels.*
If you use FLIR terrain locking to test your missiles, you must either ***downgrade to 1.11 or wait for a patch from Brett***

I DO have a fork of BDA in the works, so I MAY make a temporary fix. No guarantees.

Take care, and Merry ✝-MAS!
