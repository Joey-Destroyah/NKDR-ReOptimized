# NKDR-ReOptimized
is an **unofficial** fork of Joseano's and BrettRyland's NKD Renewed and Extended mod.
Which itself is a fork of NKDR, made by the author of the *og* North Kerbin Dynamics mod, harpwner and cukko

Credits aside, my aim is to edit the configs of various missiles and bombs in order to give them all realistic and optimized dimensions, values, and trajectories. 
e.g. The W88 got shrunk to a MUCH more reasonable size and mass and a new description, and I'm planning on giving the JASSM a terminal weave and the Tomahawk a Pop-up attack.
Unfortunately, the plumes for each missile are **hardcoded into the model files, and not in the configs**, so I cannot change or get rid of the plumes. 
I don't blame harpwner since the mod's code was originally made for **1.3.1, from a DECADE AGO, 2015**


== TO DO ==

✅ Add W76 MIRVS (using the preexisiting MIRV models; Credits to Harpwner ofc)


Fine-tune MLRS Rockets and try to fix their cluster bomb explosions

Whatever is suggested that doesn't require modelling experience since i've never done blender
